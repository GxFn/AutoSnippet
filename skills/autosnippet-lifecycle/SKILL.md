# AutoSnippet Recipe Lifecycle

This skill documents the Recipe lifecycle and clarifies what Agent can and cannot do.

---

## Lifecycle Stages

```
                  Human approves
  Candidate -----+-----> Draft Recipe -----> Active Recipe -----> Deprecated
  (Agent submits) |      (human creates)     (human publishes)    (human deprecates)
                  |
                  +-----> Rejected
                         (human rejects)
```

### Stage Details

| Stage | Who | How |
|-------|-----|-----|
| **Candidate** | Agent submits via MCP | `submit_candidate` / `submit_candidates` / `submit_draft_recipes` |
| **Review** | Human via Dashboard | Dashboard Candidates page -> approve/reject |
| **Draft Recipe** | Human via Dashboard | Approved candidate becomes draft Recipe |
| **Active Recipe** | Human via Dashboard/API | `PATCH /api/v1/recipes/:id/publish` |
| **Updated** | Human via Dashboard/API | `PATCH /api/v1/recipes/:id` |
| **Deprecated** | Human via Dashboard/API | `PATCH /api/v1/recipes/:id/deprecate` |
| **Deleted** | Human via Dashboard/API | `DELETE /api/v1/recipes/:id` |

## Agent Role: What You CAN Do

### 1. Submit Candidates
- `autosnippet_submit_candidate` - single structured candidate
- `autosnippet_submit_candidates` - batch structured candidates
- `autosnippet_submit_draft_recipes` - submit .md files as candidates

### 2. Validate and Enhance Candidates
- `autosnippet_validate_candidate` - pre-validate quality
- `autosnippet_check_duplicate` - check for duplicates
- Add structured content: rationale, steps, codeChanges, knowledgeType, complexity, tags, constraints, headers

### 3. Search and Query Recipes
- `autosnippet_list_recipes` - list with filters (kind/language/category/knowledgeType/status/complexity)
- `autosnippet_get_recipe` - get full Recipe details
- `autosnippet_list_rules` / `autosnippet_list_patterns` / `autosnippet_list_facts` - query by kind
- `autosnippet_context_search` / `autosnippet_keyword_search` / `autosnippet_semantic_search` - search
- `autosnippet_graph_query` / `autosnippet_graph_impact` - knowledge graph

### 4. Record Usage Telemetry
- `autosnippet_confirm_usage` - record when user adopts/applies a Recipe
  - `usageType: "adoption"` - user adopted the Recipe
  - `usageType: "application"` - user applied the Recipe in code

## Agent Role: What You CANNOT Do

| Forbidden Action | Why | Human Alternative |
|-----------------|-----|-------------------|
| Create Recipe directly | Agent produces candidates, not Recipes | Dashboard: approve candidate |
| Modify Recipe content | Recipe content is human-controlled | Dashboard: edit Recipe |
| Publish Recipe (draft -> active) | Publishing is a human review decision | Dashboard: publish button |
| Deprecate Recipe | Deprecation is a human lifecycle decision | Dashboard: deprecate button |
| Delete Recipe | Deletion is irreversible, human-only | Dashboard: delete button |
| Update quality scores | Quality assessment is human-controlled | Dashboard: quality panel |
| Write to `AutoSnippet/recipes/` directly | Bypass candidate review process | Submit as candidate first |

## Typical Agent Workflows

### Workflow 1: User asks to add a code pattern
1. Analyze the code pattern
2. Generate structured candidate with rationale, steps, etc.
3. `autosnippet_check_duplicate` - verify no duplicate exists
4. `autosnippet_validate_candidate` - pre-validate quality
5. `autosnippet_submit_candidate` - submit to candidate pool
6. Tell user: "Candidate submitted. Review in Dashboard Candidates page."

### Workflow 2: User asks about an existing Recipe
1. `autosnippet_context_search` or `autosnippet_list_recipes` to find it
2. `autosnippet_get_recipe` to get full details
3. Present the Recipe content to user
4. If user adopts it: `autosnippet_confirm_usage` with usageType=adoption

### Workflow 3: User asks to update a Recipe
1. Explain: "I cannot modify Recipes directly. I can submit an improved version as a new candidate."
2. `autosnippet_get_recipe` to read current content
3. Generate improved candidate based on user's feedback
4. `autosnippet_submit_candidate` - submit improved version
5. Tell user: "Improved version submitted as candidate. Update the Recipe in Dashboard."
